### Tiny JavaScript filesystem stored in LocalStorage

This project only just began very recently, and thus almost
nothing has been built yet.  To see specifically what has been
built, you can look at the [commit history](
https://github.com/nathancarter/jsfs/commits/master),
and to know what's coming, you can see [the to-do list](TODO.md).
